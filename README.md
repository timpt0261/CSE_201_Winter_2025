# The unofficial CSE201 Homeworks repository

This repo is a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for all the homeworks. A Dev Container is a one-click solution to getting up and running with the assignments without any setup.

## Setup

Click `Use this template -> Create a new repository` to copy this repo to your GitHub account.

With the copy, either click the "open with codespaces"([?](https://github.com/features/codespaces)) button above or:

- Install VSCode on your computer, and install the `Dev Containers` extension.
- If you don't already have docker installed, use the VSCode command pallette to run `Dev Containers: Install Docker`.
- Then run `Dev Containers: Clone repository in container volume` and paste the URL of this repo.

## What's inside

I've preconfigured the Dev Container to have python, jupyter notebook, VSCode extensions, all python requirements, and a basic folder structure for future assignments. There is an example notebook already provided for HW1. I will update this template regularly so don't forget to `git pull upstream main` often to get the latest changes. Feel free to submit PRs when new HWs are released or if there are any additions you want to add. I've also preconfigured python debugging to work so please use breakpoints (I made a tutorial video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtBYPD6ljWg)).

> This repo does not contain any useful information that could be used to derive a solution for any of the assignments.

Happy coding!
